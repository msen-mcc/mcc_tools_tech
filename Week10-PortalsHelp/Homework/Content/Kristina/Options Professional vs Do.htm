        <p>Professional TCA peels can cost an average of $150 to $1,500 per peel for a light to medium depth peel. They are usually done in a series of applications, spaced four weeks apart, often requiring a commitment for a series of peels. Self-performed at-home TCA peels are a much less expensive option, ranging under $100 for multiple peels. Because they are considerably less expensive, more applications may be available to you over time, which may ultimately lead to better results. </p>
        <p>At-home TCA peels are usually buffered for safety, which means the pH balance has been altered to make the peel less irritating to the skin. This results in less strength than a professional peel done in a doctor's office but is a safer option for home use. If you follow the instructions and use caution, at-home peels can provide very effective results. At-home TCA peel solution percentage strengths usually range from 7 to 30%. You can purchase the peels online. Use caution to research sellers and purchase products from a well-researched and reputable company. </p>
