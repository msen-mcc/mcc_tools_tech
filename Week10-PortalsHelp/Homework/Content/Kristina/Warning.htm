                <p>It is recommended that you have previous experience receiving professional peels by a licensed skin care professional before trying at-home peels by yourself. </p>

                <p>TCA peels are recommended for users with lighter skin tones. Check the Fitzpatrick Scale <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitzpatrick_scale" class="Hyperlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitzpatrick_scale</a> to determine your skin tone level. If your skin tone is higher than 3 on the Fitzpatrick Scale, at-home TCA peels may not be recommended, because results may cause scarring or post-inflammatory pigmentation. Check with a licensed skin care professional for advice.</p>
